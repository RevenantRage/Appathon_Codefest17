This contains the project files of 2 android applications:- Sevis Shopkeeper and Sevis Customer.
The basic idea behind the apps is to establish a better and reliable connection between vehicles` users and agencies that provide such services.
1. Shopkeeper App :- This app allows the agency to sign up in our database. Once signed up, it can provide the important info like what services they offer and mark themselves active or closed at any time (depending on the customers they are having). This app is to be distributed only to vehicle agencies.
2. Customer App :- This app allows the customers to sign up in our database and look for nearbly agencies which provides the same service they are looking for. If such a match is found, customer can send a request to the agency and they may approve/disapprove it and the same will be notified to the customer. This app is to be distributed only to customers.
